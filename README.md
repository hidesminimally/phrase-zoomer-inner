<h1>phrase-zoomer-inner (Android application)</h1>

<p><strong>CHECK!THIS!OUT!!</strong></p>

<h2>For the past 48 hours, (not including brainstorming time before)I have been writing code for a program that will revolutionize how we will communicate.</h2>

<p>We've all had those times where we're communicating to a senior citizen and s/he just can't understand what we're saying or writing. </p>

<p>We've all had those moments where we're trying to pass notes in class to that cute guy or gal, but just don't seem to have the balls to do so. </p>

<p><strong>BAM.</strong></p>

<p>The Phrase Zoomer-Inner will take any phrase you want, and create a bigger, sexier, and more elegant version of your phrase so that you can communicate to those that have a hard time seeing what you're saying. </p>

<p><strong>BAM.</strong></p>

<p>Now you can shoot that cute dude/chick your opener without having to say a word in class.</p>

<p>Now you can communicate that much clearer with your elders. </p>

<p><em>Now we change communication forever</em></p>
